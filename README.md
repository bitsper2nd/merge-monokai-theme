# Theme - Monokai Plus

[Monokai](https://monokai.pro) theme for Sublime Merge 2.

Requires [related color](https://github.com/bitsper2nd/sublime-monokai-scheme) scheme. This implementation of Monokai uses the Sublime Merge Dark Theme as a template with the Monokai color palette.

## Install

Assuming the required color scheme is installed, git clone the project or download it into your Sublime Merge `Packages`
folder as `Monokai Theme`. Edit your merge `Preferences.sublime-settings` file to use the Monokai theme:

```js
    "theme": "Monokai Pro.sublime-theme"
```
